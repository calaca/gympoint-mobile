## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org), NPM (comes with Node) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) as well as an emulator or physical device.

**PS:** you'll also need to keep the API and emails queue running. Same for the development database. You can learn more [here](https://github.com/calaca/gympoint-api/blob/master/README.md).

**PS 2:** this app has been tested on an iPhone 11 iOS 13.3 emulator.

### Installing

Simply run `npm run i` or `yarn` to install all dependencies.

### Running

To run this project in development mode just enter the command `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

## Debugging

This project is integrated with [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron). So all you have to do is [install it](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/installing.md) on your machine and keep an eye out for all the logs it provides us. You can also log stuff in it with `console.tron.log("Make 'em sweat!")`.
